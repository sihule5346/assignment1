The aim of this assignment is to get familiarized with git and basic Unix commands.

## Instructions

 1. Clone the assignment1 repository to your Cloud9 workspace.

 2. In the command window, navigate to the assignment1 repository and create a new text file `solution.txt`.

 3. Open a new file called `solution.txt` and enter the following text **exactly as it appears**: `Hello, World!`.

 4. Commit the new file to the repository and push assignment1 and the changes you made back to [github.com](http://github.com).

 ## Testing

 If you would like to check to see if your solution is correct, simply run the command `nosetests` at the command prompt.  A status message of `OK` indicates you have the correct answer.
